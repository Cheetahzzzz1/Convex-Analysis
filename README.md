# Convex-Analysis

# Overview

This assignment provides a computational verification of the convexity of the set of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices. The convexity property states that if two matrices are PSD, their convex combination remians PSD.

The problem statement states that the matrix 

             C = λA + (1-λ)B

must also be a PSD.
